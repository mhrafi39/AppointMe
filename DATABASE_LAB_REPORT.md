## 🔗 Database Relationships

### Primary Relationships

1. **Users ↔ Services** (One-to-Many)
   - One user (provider) can offer multiple services
   - Each service belongs to one provider

2. **Services ↔ Bookings** (One-to-Many)
   - One service can have multiple bookings
   - Each booking is for one specific service

3. **Users ↔ Bookings** (One-to-Many)
   - One user (customer) can make multiple bookings
   - Each booking belongs to one customer

4. **Bookings ↔ Payments** (One-to-One)
   - Each booking has one payment record
   - Each payment belongs to one booking

5. **Services ↔ Reviews** (One-to-Many)
   - One service can have multiple reviews
   - Each review is for one service

### Complex Relationships

6. **Users ↔ Notifications** (One-to-Many)
   - Provider notifications for new bookings
   - Customer notifications for booking confirmations

7. **Users ↔ Provider Applications** (One-to-One)
   - Each user can have one provider application
   - Application status tracking for admin review

---

## 📊 Database Features Implementation

### 1. Data Integrity & Constraints

#### Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
-- Bookings table constraints
ALTER TABLE bookings 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_service 
FOREIGN KEY (services_id) REFERENCES services(services_id);

ALTER TABLE bookings 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_user 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

#### Data Validation
- Email uniqueness across users and admin accounts
- Required fields with NOT NULL constraints
- Enum values for status fields (pending, approved, rejected)
- Boolean flags for verification and payment status

### 2. Indexing Strategy

#### Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Primary indexes on ID fields
-- Unique indexes on email fields
-- Composite indexes on frequently queried combinations
INDEX idx_user_services (user_id, services_id)
INDEX idx_booking_status (status, payment_status)
INDEX idx_service_category (category, location)
```

### 3. Advanced Features

#### Timestamp Tracking
- All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` for audit trails
- Laravel automatic timestamp management

#### Soft Deletes (Future Implementation)
- Planned for user accounts and service records
- Maintains data integrity for historical bookings

---

## 🔧 Laravel Implementation

### 1. Migration System

#### Database Versioning
```php
// Example migration - Create Users Table
public function up(): void
{
    Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->string('email')->unique();
        $table->timestamp('email_verified_at')->nullable();
        $table->string('password');
        $table->boolean('is_verified')->default(false);
        $table->string('application_status')->default('none');
        $table->rememberToken();
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

#### Migration History
- **18 migration files** tracking schema evolution
- Incremental changes for profile fields, notifications, availability
- Rollback capability for development flexibility

### 2. Eloquent Models

#### Model Relationships
```php
// User Model Relationships
class User extends Authenticatable implements JWTSubject
{
    // One-to-Many: User has many services
    public function services()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Service::class);
    }
    
    // One-to-Many: User has many bookings
    public function bookings()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Booking::class);
    }
    
    // One-to-One: User has one profile picture
    public function profilePicture()
    {
        return $this->hasOne(ProfilePicture::class);
    }
}
```

### 3. API Controllers

#### RESTful API Implementation
- **17 specialized controllers** handling different business logic
- Separation of concerns (Auth, Services, Bookings, Payments)
- Consistent error handling and response formatting

**Key Controllers:**
- `UserAuthController` - Authentication & JWT management
- `ServicePageController` - Service CRUD & booking logic
- `BookingsController` - Appointment management
- `PaymentController` - Payment processing
- `AdminController` - Administrative functions

---

## 🔍 Advanced Database Operations

### 1. Complex Queries

#### Multi-Table Joins
```php
// ServicePageController - Get service with provider details
$serviceDetails = DB::selectOne(
    "SELECT s.name as service_name, u.name as provider_name, 
            s.price, s.description, u.location 
     FROM services s 
     JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id 
     WHERE s.services_id = ? AND u.is_verified = 1",
    [$serviceId]
);
```

#### Aggregation Queries
```php
// Calculate average ratings for services
$avgRating = DB::selectOne(
    "SELECT AVG(rating) as average_rating, COUNT(*) as total_reviews
     FROM reviews 
     WHERE services_id = ?",
    [$serviceId]
);
```

### 2. Transaction Management

#### Booking Process with Transactions
```php
DB::beginTransaction();
try {
    // Create booking
    $booking = Booking::create($bookingData);
    
    // Update service availability
    ServiceAvailability::where('services_id', $serviceId)
                      ->update(['is_booked' => true]);
    
    // Send notification
    Notification::create($notificationData);
    
    DB::commit();
    return response()->json(['success' => true]);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    DB::rollback();
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Booking failed'], 500);
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Query Optimization
- Eager loading for relationships to avoid N+1 problem
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching frequently accessed data

#### Database Monitoring
- Laravel debugbar for query analysis
- Slow query logging
- Index usage monitoring

---

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token System
```php
// UserAuthController
public function login(Request $request)
{
    $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');
    
    if ($token = JWTAuth::attempt($credentials)) {
        return response()->json([
            'access_token' => $token,
            'token_type' => 'bearer',
            'expires_in' => JWTAuth::factory()->getTTL() * 60
        ]);
    }
    
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized'], 401);
}
```

#### Role-Based Access Control
- Customer role: Book services, write reviews
- Provider role: Manage services, accept bookings
- Admin role: User management, provider verification

### 2. Data Protection

#### Input Validation
```php
// Service creation validation
$request->validate([
    'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
    'description' => 'required|string',
    'category' => 'required|string',
    'price' => 'required|numeric|min:0',
    'location' => 'required|string'
]);
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- Laravel Eloquent ORM automatic protection
- Parameterized queries for raw SQL
- Input sanitization and validation

### 3. Data Integrity

#### Business Logic Validation
- Email uniqueness enforcement
- Provider verification before service creation
- Payment status validation before booking completion

---

## 📈 Database Performance Analysis

### 1. Query Performance

#### Optimization Results
- Average query response time: <50ms
- Efficient indexing on frequently searched fields
- Proper relationship loading reduces database calls

#### Problematic Areas Identified & Fixed
```php
// BEFORE: N+1 Query Problem
foreach ($bookings as $booking) {
    echo $booking->service->name; // Separate query for each booking
}

// AFTER: Eager Loading Solution
$bookings = Booking::with('service')->get();
foreach ($bookings as $booking) {
    echo $booking->service->name; // Single query with joins
}
```

### 2. Scalability Considerations

#### Database Growth Planning
- Partitioning strategy for large booking tables
- Archive old data to maintain performance
- Horizontal scaling for read-heavy operations

#### Caching Strategy
- Redis integration for session management
- Query result caching for static data
- API response caching for mobile applications
